## Puppeteer Browser Automation Tutorial

This project is designed to help students learn how to use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) for browser automation with Node.js. Puppeteer is a powerful library that allows you to control Chrome or Chromium, automate tasks, and perform web scraping or testing.

### What You'll Learn
- How to install and set up Puppeteer
- How to launch a browser and open pages programmatically
- How to interact with web pages (click, type, extract data)
- How to automate browser tasks for testing or scraping

### Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the example script:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

### Example Usage
The main script (`index.js`) demonstrates basic Puppeteer usage:
- Launches a browser
- Navigates to a web page
- Performs simple interactions

Feel free to modify the script and experiment with different Puppeteer features!
